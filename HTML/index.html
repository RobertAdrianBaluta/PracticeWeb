    <h1>About The Game</h1>
    <h2>...In Ultrakill, the player controls V1, a machine that uses blood as a fuel source. After the extinction of humanity, the player descends through the layers of Hell in order to harvest the blood of the various creatures in hell. Along the way V1 encounters demons, undead creatures, rival machines also looking for blood, and angels. V1 also fights a multitude of bosses, including V2, which is an improved version of V1; King Minos (and Minos Prime), a defeated king of Hell; and Gabriel (named for the Abrahamic archangel), a supreme angel sent to stop V1..</h2>

       <h1>The Piercing Revolver</h1>
       <h2>The Piercer Revolver appears to be an energy-powered railgun-pistol hybrid, with a futuristic metallic texture and look. Located near this weapon’s hammer equivalent is a small screen that indicates the cooldown of its alternate fire. It has lights on its screen, cylinder and its barrel, giving off a neon blue glow.</h2>

       <h1>Marksman Revoler</h1>
       <h2>The Marksman Revolver appears almost identical to the Piercer Revolver, but has neon green lights as well as a different interface that indicates the amount of available coins. The display also indicates how long until each coin recharges, and makes an audible "ding" noise when one is available again.</h2>
